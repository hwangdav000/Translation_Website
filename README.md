## Translation Website
This is a website that I created to translate popular media (songs, books)
from Korean to English. (Still work in progress). Implemented song translations
a working navigation for book chapters, light/dark mode.

Created using React and Bootstrap.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm i`

to initalize

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
